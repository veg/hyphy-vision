# HyPhy Vision
## Visualize HyPhy results in your browser. 

This repository holds visualizations written in React and D3 for JSON results
generated by HyPhy. Reading raw numerical data can be tedious, and would
oftentimes require a number of post-processing steps in your favorite scripting
language to make sense of it. While you definitely can still do that, we provide
custom, interactive, web-based visualizations to help facilitate making
inferences about your results and less time data munging.

# Start viewing your results now
Visit the associated site for this page at [here](http://veg.github.io/hyphy-vision/).

## I don't have results though, and I'm not sure where to begin
If you want to start exploring various ways of detecting selection on your
sequence data now, please visit [Datamonkey](datamonkey.org) or [Datamonkey
Test](test.datamonkey.org) with your multiple sequence alignment ready (in FASTA
or NEXUS format). You can also run our methods locally by installing
[HyPhy](hyphy.org).
